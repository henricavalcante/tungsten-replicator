# Simple Bash Script To Check Tungsten Services
# Nagios Plugin For NRPE
#
# This script accepts two arguments, {{-r}} and {{-c}}.  The {{-r}} argument 
# will tell the script to check that the replicator and manager services are 
# running.  The {{-c}} argument will check the connector service, the 
# arguments may be given individually or together.  If any service is not 
# running, the script will return a critical error.

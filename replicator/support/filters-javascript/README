                          JavaScript filter example

1 Overview

This is a description about sample filter.js script.

JavaScriptFilter allows to develop JavaScript filters without coding any Java
at all. The script is precompiled once and then called on every filtered event.

WARNING: filter.js is intended only for explanatory purposes and not to be used
in production environment, unless you fully understand what it does.

2 Getting Started

In order to use this sample filter one should define it in
replicator.properties first. There is an example of how to accomplish that in
provided replicator.properties.mysql or replicator.properties.oracle files
(see FILTERS section):

  replicator.filter.javascript=com.continuent.tungsten.replicator.filter.JavaScriptFilter
  replicator.filter.javascript.script=../support/filters-javascript/filter.js
  replicator.filter.javascript.sample_custom_property="Sample value"
  
To activate this filter add it to replicator.prefilter or replicator.postfilter
property (multiple filters may be separated with commas):

  replicator.prefilter=javascript  
or
  replicator.postfilter=javascript

3 Usage

After completing steps described above, filter.js will be compiled next time
you start replicator and called out on every event. Look for messages coming
from this filter in /log/trep.log

As you can see from the source code, filter.js will delay every event 1 second
and print a short comment of what was inside the event.

its comments.
